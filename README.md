# dimensionality_reduction
it includes PLA(Principal Component Analysis ), LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis ), kernel PLA(Principal Component Analysis )

in this PLA and LDA is for the linear related data

but PLA is fall under unsupervised manner 
and LDA fall under the supervised manner 

while Kernel PLA is for analysis of non linear form of model
